# Future Development Plan for Privacy Protocol

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the Privacy Protocol application. The initial version provides a keyword-based CLI tool. The following steps aim to expand its capabilities, incorporate AI, and add more user-centric features as described in the original concept.

## Phase 1: Enhancing Core Interpreter & UI

### 1.1 Improved Clause Detection
- **NLP-based Sentence/Clause Segmentation:** Instead of simple keyword presence, use NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) to accurately identify sentence and clause boundaries. This will allow flagging the specific clause containing the keyword, not just noting the keyword's presence in the document.
- **Contextual Analysis:** Develop basic contextual analysis to reduce false positives. For example, "we do *not* sell data" should not be flagged as "data selling."

### 1.2 Basic Web Interface
- **Simple Web UI:** Develop a basic web interface (e.g., using Flask or Django) where users can paste privacy policy text or upload a document for analysis.
- **Display Results:** Show flagged clauses, explanations, and categories in a user-friendly format.

## Phase 2: AI Integration for Deeper Understanding

### 2.1 AI-Powered Clause Classification
- **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch with transformers like BERT) to classify legal clauses into predefined categories (e.g., Data Collection, Data Usage, Data Sharing, User Rights, Security, Data Retention).
- **Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune pre-trained language models on a dataset of privacy policy clauses.
- **Disagreeable Clause Identification:** Enhance the model to predict the "questionableness" or potential disagreeableness of a clause based on learned patterns. This would be more sophisticated than simple keyword matching.

### 2.2 Plain-Language Translation with AI
- **Summarization & Paraphrasing:** Use sequence-to-sequence models (e.g., T5, BART) to translate complex legal jargon into simpler, plain-language explanations. This would be an improvement over predefined explanations.

### 2.3 "What If" Scenario Generation (Advanced)
- **Knowledge Graphs & Reasoning:** Explore building a knowledge graph from privacy policies.
- **LLM-driven Scenarios:** Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with carefully crafted prompts to generate potential "worst-case" interpretations or ambiguities in clauses. This would require significant research and potentially access to powerful models.

## Phase 3: User-Centric Features & Personalization

### 3.1 Personalized Privacy Profiles
- **User Preferences:** Allow users to define their privacy tolerance levels (e.g., no data selling, okay with anonymized analytics).
- **Customized Analysis:** Tailor the flagging and risk scoring based on these user profiles. Store preferences securely.

### 3.2 Privacy Risk Scoring & Dashboard
- **Scoring Algorithm:** Develop an algorithm to calculate a "Privacy Risk Score" based on the number and severity of flagged clauses, weighted by user preferences.
- **Dashboard:** Create a user dashboard to visualize risk scores for different services and track their overall privacy posture.

### 3.3 Historical Policy Tracking & Change Alerts
- **Storage:** Store analyzed policies (or hashes/diffs) to track versions.
- **Change Detection:** Implement a system to periodically re-analyze policies for known services and alert users to significant changes, highlighting what was added, removed, or modified.

### 3.4 Actionable Recommendations & Opt-Out Navigator
- **Database of Actions:** Compile a database of opt-out links, data request page URLs, and contact information for various services.
- **Automated Assistance:** Potentially generate template emails for data deletion requests.

## Phase 4: Community & Collaboration (V2 Concept)

### 4.1 Community-Driven Insights
- **Aggregated Data:** Anonymously aggregate data on commonly flagged clauses or problematic services (with user consent).
- **Shared Knowledge Base:** Allow users to (optionally and anonymously) report new concerning clauses or suggest better explanations.

## Technology Stack Considerations:
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django)
- **NLP:** spaCy, NLTK
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user data, policies, and analysis results.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Vue, or Angular for a more complex UI).

## Data Acquisition and Annotation:
- A significant challenge will be acquiring and annotating a dataset of privacy policies and clauses for training AI models. This might involve:
    - Publicly available policy datasets.
    - Web scraping (respecting `robots.txt`).
    - Crowdsourcing or expert annotation for clause categorization and risk assessment.

This roadmap provides a high-level overview. Each feature will require detailed planning and iterative development.

## Phase X: Advanced Service Profile Management (Future)

### X.1. Merging or Linking Multiple Analyses for a Single Service

**Objective:** Allow users to consolidate multiple analysis entries (currently separate `ServiceProfile` objects, especially those created from pasted text or different URLs for the same service) under a single, canonical user-defined service. This would provide a more accurate historical view and risk assessment for a service over time, rather than treating each pasted analysis as a unique service.

**Conceptual User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to select multiple "Pasted Analysis (timestamp)" entries from my dashboard or history that I know are for the same service (e.g., "My Bank App") and merge them, so they appear as one service with a versioned history.
- As a user, if I analyze a policy from `http://example.com/privacy` and later from `http://www.example.com/legal/privacy-policy`, I want to be able to tell the system these represent the same service.

**Potential Approach & UI Concepts:**

1.  **Service Identification & Grouping:**
    - When a `ServiceProfile` is created (especially from pasted text), its `service_id` is currently the `policy_identifier` (timestamp). Its `service_name` is "Pasted Analysis (identifier)".
    - The `user_defined_name` allows users to give it a meaningful name.
    - **Challenge:** How to link multiple `ServiceProfile` entries that the user *knows* are the same logical service, especially if their `service_id`s are different (e.g., multiple pasted texts, or different URLs for the same service).

2.  **Merge/Link UI Action:**
    - On the Dashboard or History page, allow selection of multiple `ServiceProfile` entries (e.g., via checkboxes).
    - Provide a "Merge/Link Selected Services" action button.

3.  **Merge/Link Process:**
    - **Option A (True Merge - Complex):**
        - User selects a "primary" `ServiceProfile` whose `service_id` and `user_defined_name` will become canonical.
        - The `policy_history_identifier`s from the other selected `ServiceProfile`s are associated with this primary service.
        - This would require a new data model, perhaps a `CanonicalService` that has one `user_defined_name` and a list of associated `policy_identifier`s (from `policy_history`).
        - The `service_profiles.json` would then store these `CanonicalService` objects.
        - The dashboard would list `CanonicalService`s. Clicking one would show its latest analysis, and also provide access to the history of all linked policy versions.
    - **Option B (Linking via User-Defined Name - Simpler):**
        - When a user renames multiple `ServiceProfile` entries to have the *exact same* `user_defined_name`:
        - The system could *display* them grouped under this common `user_defined_name` on the dashboard.
        - Each original `ServiceProfile` (and its `service_id`) would still exist, but the UI would group them.
        - The dashboard would need logic to identify all profiles with the same `user_defined_name` and present them as versions/analyses of one service.
        - This is less about data merging and more about display-time grouping.

4.  **Impact on Risk Scoring & History:**
    - If true merging occurs, the `UserPrivacyProfile`'s overall risk score would need to consider only the latest version of each *canonical* service.
    - Historical views for a canonical service would show all its linked/merged policy versions.

**Considerations for Implementation:**
- **User Experience:** The merging/linking process must be intuitive and allow for undoing or correction if mistakes are made.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring that policy history links (`latest_policy_identifier`) and other metadata are correctly updated or re-associated is critical.
- **Complexity:** True data merging (Option A) is significantly more complex than display-time grouping (Option B). Option B might be a more feasible first step towards this concept.

**Initial Focus (if this feature were prioritized):**
- Likely start with **Option B (Linking via User-Defined Name)** for display grouping, as it requires fewer backend data model changes initially. This would involve enhancing the dashboard to group `ServiceProfile` entries that share the same non-null `user_defined_name`.
